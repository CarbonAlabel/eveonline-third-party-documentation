## Welcome to the Third-Party Developer(s) Documentation for EVE Online.
This is a community supported repository for instructions and guidance that is useful for those making third-party tools for EVE.

It is intended to always be a living document and will be frequently updated to reflect changes in the APIs and/or services.

## XML API and CREST
On May 8th, 2018 XML API and CREST were retired and [ESI](esi/index.md) became the sole API available for EVE Online.

## Contributing
There is a lot of work to be done on this site and any contributions are welcome. The docs are hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccpgames/eveonline-third-party-documentation), where anyone can fork it, commit changes and submit a pull request to get your changes onto the site.

The source files are written in markdown, which is very easy to get started using. There is a fairly good introduction to markdown available from [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Please follow the `recommonmark` guidelines for [math formulas](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html#math-formula) and [inline math](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html#inline-math).

There is a contributors file, as well as more info on contributing to the documentation on the repository.
